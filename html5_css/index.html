                <h2> The Roles that Social media play in Society</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3> The way our culture is affected</h3>
                <p> Social media plays a bigger role in our society then we might realize. The influencers of social media get payed to review products and more or less to sell themselves as a picture perfect role model. If society isnt forming opinions on their own than they are forming them on a more fictious model. If society could balance the differnece and form connections outside of a virual environment. Their views and opinions are based solely on what is most popular or the trendiest. The influencers who get on certain platforms can shape a teens mind into thinking that a specific way of thinking is the only viable option. This isn't true we must not let social media frame our brain into thinking that we must conform and act how society feels you should. If we base our only connections to those on social media networks how are we truly being our authentic self? How can we set a good example on social media to help generations to come that is the questions we should be finding going viral. Social media can foster good connections and bad it is entirely up to our own minds to differentiate</p>
                <h3>Impact on Youth</h3>
                <p>Most teens credit social media with having the ability to make friends and gain popularity. A poll taken once said that although one in every five teen says social media sites hurt their mental health. There was a recent survey done here in the U.S. It said that parents who have teens ages 13 to 17, the parents are generally more worried than their children about the mental health of teenagers today.
And while both groups call out social media outlets, teens and adults continue to use these sites and networks. It's vital and our job as parents to play a postive role in our children's lives although they might find this intrusive it could literally save a teens life. Social media platforms allow freedom of expression and help foster communications all around the world. We as a society need to make sure were advocating for our children to have postive role models even though they are on social media.</p>
